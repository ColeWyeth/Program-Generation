# Program-Generation

This project is designed to randomly generate (or sample)
algorithms to solve problems. The framework is general enough
to work in diverse simulated worlds, controlling agents
with a set of observations.

The obvious challenge is the exploding number of possible
algorithms needed to solve complex problems.
